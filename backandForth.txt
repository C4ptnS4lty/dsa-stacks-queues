You would want to use a doubly linked list so that each node contains
this.val; where val is a url
this.first; the first/default brpwser url
this.last; the last one visited before going backwards. Will be set differently if a new url path comes in.
this.next; the url node that was clicked after the current url
this.prev; the url node that was before the current url.


also include two functions for traversing.

function traverseforward() will set current node to either the next entered url or a url already saved
note that traverse forward will replace this.next with the newest chosen url, whether typed, selected, or saved.

function traversebackward() will set current node to previous url if available.
